My takeaways:
1. Table of Content 1:45
2. Introduction 2:52
2.1 What is data analysis 2:52
2.2 Data analysis tools 4:38
2.3 Data analysis process 7:31
2.4 Data Analysis vs Data Science 8:56
2.5 Python and PyData Ecosystem 9:28
2.6 Python data analysis vs Excel 9:46
3. Real example data analysis with Python: getting a sense of what you can learn from this course 11:00
4. How to use Jupyter Notebooks 30:50
5. Intro to NumPy 1:04:58
5.1 Low-level basis: binary numbers, memory footprint 1:09:32
5.2 Python is not memory efficient to store numbers since it wraps everything into objects. Whereas in NumPy, we can select the number of bits to represent numbers 1:22:50
5.3 NumPy can compute arrays faster than Python 1:24:58
5.4 NumPy tutorial: NumPy arrays, matrices 1:29:47
5.5 Memory footprint and performance: Python vs NumPy 1:53:14
6. Intro to Pandas: getting, processing and visualizing data 1:56:58
6.1 Pandas data structure: Series 1:58:41
6.2 We can change the index of Pandas series and this is fundamentally different from NumPy arrays 2:02:55
6.3 The upper limit of slicing in Pandas series is included, whereas, in NumPy, the limit is excluded 2:07:55
6.4 Pandas data structure: DataFrames 2:14:36
6.5 Most operations in Pandas are immutable 2:29:10
6.7 Reading external data 2:36:47
6.8 Pandas plotting 2:44:41
7. Data cleaning 2:47:18
7.1 Handling miss data 2:51:40
7.2 Cleaning invalidate values 3:03:17
7.3 Handling duplicated data 3:06:09
7.4 Handling text data 3:11:05
